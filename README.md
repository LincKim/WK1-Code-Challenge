# INTRODUCTION
This is my first coding challenge which is designed to be able to test my current understanding on JavaScript upto this point and time in the bootcamp.

The code written herein is ONLY for academic purposes.

# OVERVIEW
The code written herein is a reflection of my current understanding on JavaScripts's basics such as Functions and other objects within the Language's syntax

Feel free to go through the code and maybe you will learn one or two things in this not complicated code.

# Description
This project is purely JavaScript code and does not contain any HTML or CSS codes. If time allows then in the future these (HTML and CSS) codes will be added to imrove on the interactivity.

# Testing 
The code can be tested through the Developer tools at the Console.

Take the example of my first code challenge, the code can be tested by copy pasting the code on the browser console then calling the function while passing arguements to the functions.

The console should return a valid value that is within the set parameters in the code.

My titles have been written as comments to separate the different code challenges.
