# INTRODUCTION
This is my first coding challenge which is designed to be able to test my current understanding on JavaScript upto this point and time in the bootcamp.

The code written herein is ONLY for academic purposes.

# OVERVIEW
The code written herein is a reflection of my current understanding on JavaScripts's basics such as Functions and other objects within the Language's syntax.

The Code Challenges are three(3) and you can notice them through the the line of code that have been commented out and they begin with double #Tag.

Feel free to go through the code and maybe you will learn one or two things in this not complicated code.

# Description
This project is purely JavaScript code and does not contain any HTML or CSS codes. If time allows then in the future these (HTML and CSS) codes will be added to imrove on the interactivity.

## Installation

To use this repo on your machine requires some simple steps depected below:

### Procedure

- Open a terminal / command line interface on your computer and navigate to your desired directory to clone the repository.
- Clone the repo by using the following:

        git clone https://github.com/LincKim/WK1-Code-Challenge.git 
        
        or using the SSh Key:

        git clone *git@github.com:LincKim/WK1-Code-Challenge.git*


- Be patient as it creates a copy on your local machine for you.
- Change directory to the repo folder:

        cd WK1-Code-Challenge

- (Optional) Open it in ``Visual Studio Code``

        code .

- (Alternate Option) Open it in any editor of your choice.
- You are one step closer to achieving your goal.

# Testing 
The code can be tested through the Developer tools of the browser, that is, either preferably Chrome or Firefox browser.

Navigate to the console section and that is your playground to check on how the code runs.

Take the example of my first code challenge, the code can be tested by copy pasting the code on the browser console then calling the function while passing arguments to the functions.

The console should return a valid value that is within the set parameters in the code.
